# Electronic-Labyrinth
Servo controlled labyrinth game powered by CPX

Frame created from cardboard with 2 axes of rotation attached to servos to rotate the maze. The maze cartridges are made from laser cut acrylic and plywood. They fit snugly in the cardboard frame to allow for them to be swapped out for other maze designs. When the ball reaches the end of the maze, it falls into a collection system and returns to the user.
